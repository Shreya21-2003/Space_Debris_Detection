# ðŸš€ Space Debris Detection
Space debris detection is one of the rising spatial challenges that must be addressed to avoid hindrances to future space exploration and satellite operations. With increasing launches of space shuttles and rockets, a vast mess of old satellites, tiny fragments from collisions, and rocket parts accumulate in Earth's orbit. These debris pose a significant threat to active satellites and space stations, making it essential to develop technologies for their detection and analysis.

To facilitate research and study in this field, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model has been effectively utilized to analyze categorical data related to space debris. This model has achieved a notable accuracy of 91.2%, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.

# ðŸ§  Methodology
The proposed approach leverages an ANN model named DebrisNet, designed specifically for categorical data related to space debris detection.

# ðŸ”¹ DebrisNet Architecture:
Six densely connected layers organized into three dense blocks.

Dual-input design with multiple hidden layers for robust feature extraction.

Three hidden layers with increasing units:

Layer 1: 16 units, ReLU activation.

Layer 2: 32 units, ReLU activation.

Layer 3: 64 units, ReLU activation.

Output layer:

4 units representing distinct classes of space debris (e.g., satellites, rocket fragments, debris particles).
Softmax activation to produce probabilistic outputs for each class.
# ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
High precision and resilient performance in detecting and classifying space debris.

Ability to discern intricate patterns and correlations within input data.

Scalable architecture for handling increasing categories of debris types.

# ðŸ“Š Experimental Results
The DebrisNet model has been rigorously tested and evaluated, yielding impressive results:

âœ… Accuracy: Over 90% on the test dataset.

ðŸš€ Performance: Outperforms existing space debris detection techniques.

ðŸŒŒ Robustness: Demonstrated consistent performance across various debris types, including:

Satellites
Rocket fragments
Small debris particles
